**Prompt:**

> I'm building an HTML resume template, can you give me a 3 hex colors for a color palette?

**Reply:**
> Sure, here are three hex color codes that could work well together for an HTML resume template:
> 1. #2C3E50 - This is a deep blue color that could work well for headers or accent elements.
> 2. #F5B041 - This is a warm orange color that could be used for call-to-action buttons or other attention-grabbing elements.
> 3. #ECF0F1 - This is a light gray color that could be used for the background or as a secondary color for text or other elements.
