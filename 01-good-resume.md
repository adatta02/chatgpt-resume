**Prompt:**
> How can I make sure my resume isn't discarded by applicant tracking systems?

**Reply:**
> 1. Use relevant keywords: Research the job description and industry to identify relevant keywords and phrases.
     > Use these keywords in your resume, particularly in the skills, experience, and education sections.
     > Avoid using irrelevant or outdated terms that may not be recognized by the ATS.
> 2. Use a standard font: Use a standard font, such as Arial or Times New Roman, that is easy to read and
     > won't confuse the ATS. Avoid using fancy or decorative fonts that may not be recognized by the ATS.
> 3. Avoid using graphics and tables: ATS may have difficulty interpreting graphics and tables,
     > and may discard them altogether. Stick to a simple and straightforward design that is easy to scan and understand.
> 4. Use bullet points: Use bullet points to highlight your experience and accomplishments. This helps the ATS identify and parse out key information.
> 5. Save your resume as a plain text file: When submitting your resume online, save it as a plain text file rather than a PDF or Word document.
     > This can help ensure that the ATS can read and parse your resume correctly.
> 6. Proofread your resume: Spelling and grammatical errors can confuse the ATS and lead to your resume being discarded.
     > Proofread your resume carefully to ensure that it is error-free and easy to read.
