> As a hiring manager at a Fortune 1000 company, when reviewing a resume, here are the top three things that I look for:
> 1. Relevant Experience and Skills: I look for relevant experience and skills that match the 
> requirements of the position. I check to see if the candidate has worked in a similar role or industry 
> before and has the necessary technical, communication, and interpersonal skills required for the job.
> 2. Achievements and Accomplishments: I pay attention to the candidate's achievements and accomplishments. I look for 
> evidence of success and impact in their previous roles, such as metrics, awards, and recognition. This gives me 
> an idea of their potential to make a meaningful contribution to our organization.
> 3. Education and Training: I also consider the candidate's education and training. I look for relevant degrees, 
> certifications, and training programs that are related to the job. This can give me an indication of the 
> candidate's level of knowledge and expertise in the field.

**Prompt:**
> Focusing on the writing , what are the top 3 things you look for?

**Reply:**
> 1. Clarity: I look for writing that is clear, concise, and easy to understand. The candidate should be able to 
> effectively communicate their skills and experiences without using overly complex language or industry jargon. 
> It's important that the content is organized and presented in a logical manner, making it easy to follow.
> 2. Grammar and Spelling: I pay attention to grammar and spelling errors, as they can create a negative 
> impression of the candidate's attention to detail and professionalism. A resume should be free of grammatical 
> errors, typos, and other mistakes. I also look for consistency in formatting and style throughout the resume.
> 3. Impactful language: I look for impactful language that highlights the candidate's achievements and accomplishments. 
> Using strong action verbs and descriptive language can help a candidate stand out and demonstrate their value. 
> Additionally, using quantitative data to support accomplishments can provide more concrete evidence of a candidate's success.

> 2. Organization: I pay attention to the organization and layout of the resume. The content should be presented 
> in a clear and logical order, with headings and sections that are easy to navigate. A well-organized resume 
> can help the hiring manager quickly find the information they need to evaluate the candidate's qualifications.
> 3. Consistency: I look for consistency in the design and formatting throughout the resume. Consistency in font, spacing, and formatting can help create a cohesive and polished look. Additionally, consistency in the use of bullet points, bolding, and other formatting can help draw attention to important information and make the resume more scannable.
