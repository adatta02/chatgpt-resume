# ChatGPT x Resume

### What is this?

This repo contains a collection of ChatGPT prompts to help you write or revise your resume. 
It also has prompts to help you generate a cover letter for a specific job post.

### Should you use this?

Probably not. Definitely not without reviewing the ChatGPT output.

I (Ashish) have no qualifications or relevant experience that would make me particularly good at writing or reading resumes.
So use at your own risk.

### I want to live dangerously, let's do this

Love the sense of adventure!

The overall thinking is that:

* A "technically well written" resume, one that's free of spelling errors and written clearly, will be well received by hiring managers
* When candidates apply for a job, their resumes are often reviewed by automated systems that are looking for specific keywords
* ChatGPT isn't good at writing interesting prose, but it is good at writing "technically correct" paragraphs that include specific elements
* So we should be able to use ChatGPT to write the text for a strong resume
