# ChatGPT x Resume

## What is this?

This repo contains a collection of ChatGPT prompts to help you write or revise your resume. 
It also has prompts to help you generate a cover letter for a specific job post.

## Should you use this?

Probably not. Definitely not without reviewing the ChatGPT output.

I (Ashish) have no qualifications or relevant experience that would make me particularly good at writing or reading resumes.
So use at your own risk.
